Pickles is an affectionate and happy tabby-Siamese mix boy, about 8 years old. He arrived at the shelter as a stray, and no one has claimed him.

When Pickles arrived, he was fighting a persistent Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus upper respiratory infection which, though no longer causing nasal symptoms or respiratory discomfort, has left his beautiful baby blues a bit sore and red-rimmed. This is a common infection in cats, and generally resolves on its own, with some topical antibiotic support being given to Pickles' eyes to help while he heals. It is not a serious disease in most cases (including Pickles), but is prone to becoming a latent infection that may flare up during times of stress.

Pickles says this means he requires daily snuggles and belly rubs, plus a little play time, some excellent sun-spots, and all the love you can spare. He seems tolerant of other cats, and has not yet been tested with dogs. If you have a dog and would like to add Pickles to the family, let us know about your dog in your application, and we will find a similar cat-friendly dog for Pickles to meet before adoption.

Pickles may be considered a "senior" at 8, but with a loving and attentive home, he knows he has many more wonderful years to spend with you! He would be happy as an indoor-only or indoor/outdoor cat, and is most definitely going to want to snuggle with you in bed on those dark winter mornings.
