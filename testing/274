This handsome furry gentleman, about 5 years of age, was rescued by Ferry County law enforcement from a long-term stay inside a locked car. Thankfully, the weather was not TOO hot and not TOO cold, so although Deputy was hungry and thirsty when rescued, he was otherwise in pretty good shape.

He does have one medical challenge, which we will be handling. Deputy has a large polyp growing inside one ear, which requires a total ear canal ablation to cure. Which came first, did the polyp cause his chronic painful ear infection, or did his chronic painful ear infection give root to the polyp? It really doesn't matter; this sweet boy deserves to have no pain and no infection, so we will get him the specialty surgery he needs.

Deputy likes both cats and dogs, and all sorts of humans. He will do well as an indoor/outdoor or indoor only cat (but he's not super fond of car rides any longer). He is playful and affectionate and would do fine in pretty much any sort of home. If you would like him to come home to foster with you, that is possible if you would be willing to take him to his ablation appointment, which will most likely be in either Pullman or Spokane. After he is medically cleared, he will be ready for official adoption. You are also welcome to commit to adopting him now, but leave him in our care until he's ready to head home to you!
