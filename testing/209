Oslo, born 7/10/21, arrived at the shelter four months ago along with his much more outgoing brother. His brother was quickly adopted, but Oslo's shy nature finds him getting overlooked time and again for the popular kids... while Oslo stands against the wall wondering why no one wants to bring him home.

We say "CHIN UP, Oslo!" We know some lucky person is going to bring this sweet boy home and allow him to BLOSSOM. He loves a good game with a wand toy, and that is always an excellent ice-breaker. While it may take Oslo a little longer than the typical "ambassador cat" to settle in and be comfortable in his new home, winning him over will be well worth the wait.

As you can see, he has grown a bit, um... portly... while waiting for his new family to find him. Don't worry, Oslo, we all understand comfort eating, especially after the past couple of years... once you have a best friend to play with those wand toys and then snuggle you on the couch, you won't need to fill your empty space inside with extra kibble - it will be filled with purrs and love.
