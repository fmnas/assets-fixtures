Kinky, a lovely 8-month old tabby girl named for her cute little kinky tail, surprised us. She came in with a feral colony on which we did Trap-Neuter-Return. Unlike most of the colony, Kinky decided she really, really wanted to stay at the shelter, rather than going back to her property. She developed a persistent upper respiratory infection which has been battled back by long acting antibiotics, and during her treatment she showed us that she is actually a very loveable, affectionate, playful girl! OK, Kinky, you've convinced us - you are officially ADOPTABLE! Congratulations on your promotion.

Kinky gets along well with other cats and loves all sorts of humans. She has not yet been tested with dogs, but we will be happy to do so prior to adoption if you have a cat-loving pooch in the family.
