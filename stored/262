This beautiful long-haired tortoiseshell girl, who will turn 2 in May 2022, arrived as a stray and was never claimed. She is both playful and affectionate, and her fur looks better and better every day, now that she is receiving regular care and nutrition. She would be happy in pretty much any sort of family, and could be indoor-only or indoor/outdoor. We have not yet tested Sarita with dogs, but will do so if you and your dog think she'd be a great fit for your family!

The adorable stripe down her nose adds just a little extra character to her beauty - and she is ready to brighten up your home with her charms.
