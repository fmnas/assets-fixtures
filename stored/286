Please, whatever you do, do NOT tell Sage she is a cat. She is a 6 year old funny, quirky, opinionated, cantankerous furry little human in a cat suit, and she has moods. If you are looking for an independent but affectionate companion, one who is not afraid to snuggle on your lap and then bite you none too gently if you decide you want to stand up, one who will let you know when she wants to play, when she wants to eat, when she wants affection, when she wants to go outside, when she wants to come inside - no, outside - no, inside, one who expects you to follow her every command and accept her love or her displeasure as she sees fit, Sage is for you!

She really wants to have an indoor-outdoor lifestyle - DON'T CRIMP HER STYLE!! - and will do best with an experienced cat owner who understands a cat's need to work off energies through play, their tendencies toward overstimulation, and how to read cat body language. Sage is not a cat that falls into the "awww, look, a cute little bundle of joy" category. She is her own person, just as you are, and she will respect your individuality if you respect hers. Sage wants to be your companion, your friend, your boss, NOT just a pet.

She also doesn't think you need ANY pets, and would prefer to be your only furry companion.

Sage apologizes for her boring video - it was 110 in the shade and she really didn't feel like performing for the camera, so just accepted some petting while she relaxed on her blankie.
