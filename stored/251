Kittywampus was surrendered to the shelter when the person caring for him was injured and no longer able to provide care. He arrived at Forget Me Not somewhat shut-down and traumatized from a life lived outside only for over 6 years, where he found a way to evade predators and survive the highest and lowest of temperatures through the seasons. In his first photos, where he is mostly a "monorail" or "loaf" cat, frozen in an attempt to fade into the background, we thought he had a long way to go to regain his self confidence. We originally listed him under our Shy Cat Special... but here it is, 5 weeks later, and we can officially announce that Kittywampus has graduated from the shy cat program and is now a fully qualified PET CAT.

This chonky big boi is 14 pounds of purrs and snuggles. He has discovered that life on the couch at the shelter, being adored by the staff and volunteers, is far preferable to life surviving outside. He's a favorite of many of the folk around the shelter, and one today said "I bet kids could even dress him up, he is THAT chill."

Kittywampus would do well as an indoor-only or indoor-outdoor cat (though we recommend giving him plenty of indoor-only time to start, so he can acclimate to his new home and family). His previous caregiver said he was not good with other cats or dogs, so he would likely appreciate being the only pet in his home.

We think he will be blissfully curled up on your lap and keeping the end of your bed warm in almost no time.
