California, born 10/1/18, is an adult from a feral colony on which we were doing TNR. After getting to know her, we felt she was worthy of a status upgrade to House Panther (aka, a pet). She came in with a terrible case of allergic dermatitis, generally indicative of an allergy to fleas. She has since been treated for fleas, treated with steroids and antibiotics to clear up her skin, and is now a sleek black beauty who is accustomed to handling and is quite tolerant of being picked up and petted. She will like a calm and relaxed home, and we recommend she be kept indoor only to avoid a repeat of her dermatitis.

She gets along fine with other cats, but we do NOT recommend dogs for California. You can see in her video how much she enjoys attention; we can't imagine asking this beautiful girl to live out her life outside as a feral cat! She would like a calm home, and would be fine as an only cat if you just want one panther.

The good news is, Forget Me Not is having a "Shy Cat Special", so a shy cat or kitten has a $35 adoption fee, and you may add a second shy cat as a buddy at no additional cost!
