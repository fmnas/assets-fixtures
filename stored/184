Meet Tweedledee and Tweedledum, a pair of brothers born about 3/1/21 who were surrendered by an "owner" who had gotten them from a friend shortly prior, but then decided they didn't want them after all.

* C1732 TWEEDLEDEE - long-haired black male, a little skittish around new sounds and people, very loving
* C1733 **TWEEDLEDUM** - short-haired white and tabby male, more scared than his brother, handleable

These brothers are include in our current SHY CAT SPECIAL, $35 adoption fee and adopt a second shy cat as a buddy for no additional charge. Tweedledum really relies on his somewhat braver brother to help guide him through life, so we will be giving preference to an applicant who would like them both. However, a home separate from each other is still better than no home at all, so if all else fails, we will adopt them separately.
