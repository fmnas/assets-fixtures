Samson and Delilah were originally part of a feral colony. A neighbor to the property where the ferals lived brought in Samson and Delilah when they were fairly young and kept them as indoor-only cats. However, they were not treated as pets, but were pretty much left to their own devices. When the person who took them in moved away, they realized they couldn't just put them back outside with the rest of the colony, as they had been indoor-only for so long they no longer had the skills to survive as ferals. Instead, they came to Forget Me Not, where they are in a complicated area of adoptability!

They are not fully "pet quality" - neither is very fond of being touched, and being picked up is a huge violation of their purrrrrsonal space. Samson loves to play with wand toys, and that helps him warm up to humans faster than his sister Delilah, who acts more like a plant than a cat at this time. She would be quite happy to be ignored and provided with food, water, and an indoor home with Samson.

We considered splitting them up and placing Delilah as a barn cat and Samson as an adoptee, but when separated briefly as a test, the two cried endlessly looking for each other. They let us know with no doubt that they MUST go to the same home; all their lives so far, they have been each other's everything, and that is likely to continue for life. We do expect both to slowly adapt to their new people; they will probably never be "ambassador cats" that run to greet your guests, but with enough time, they will become independent but accepting companions (they even used to sleep on their person's bed).

This pair is eligible for our Shy Cat Special - $35 adoption fee for the pair.

If you have the patience to allow these cats to be themselves and acclimate to your home at their own pace, they will be forever grateful for the offer of your home and love. In the video, Delilah makes an appearance at 3:30; the whole beginning is Samson playing and not really liking being touched.
