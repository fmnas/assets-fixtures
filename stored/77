Temple is another beautiful floofy girl who arrived as a rather unkempt stray and is rediscovering her inner and outer beauty as part of the Forget Me Not family, while she waits for her forever home.

Temple is affectionate and playful, seems to like both dogs and other cats, and thinks people are pretty great! Her coat requires some regular brushing - just a few minutes a day will help keep her in tip-top condition. She would do well in pretty much any home that wants a fun and loving cat companion, and would thrive as either an indoor-only or indoor-outdoor cat.
