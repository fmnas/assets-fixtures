Bravo is a delightful 5-month-old grey target tabby girl with white tux and toes. She was adopted as a young kitten, but in spite of all her attempts to win over the other cat in her family, the other kitty simply did NOT want to share his home with another cat. We brought Bravo back and assured her it was nothing she said or did, and she was quite happy to be welcomed warmly by the other kittens at the shelter.

She has never been outside and will do best as an indoor-only cat. She is young enough to adapt to other cats and dogs easily, and will enjoy a family of one or a family of ten - she has enough love and playfulness for everyone she meets. Bravo is looking forward to finding her forever home in 2022!
