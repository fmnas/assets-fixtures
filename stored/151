 Coffee came in as part of our "Brunch Bunch," a group of 5 young adult cats who were left behind when their owner moved away. Her four friends (calicos, tortoiseshell, orange) found new homes quickly, but as the all-too-common refrain goes, black cats are often overlooked.

Coffee, born 10/1/18, is a lovely and affectionate shorthaired black female with just a touch of white at her throat. She really enjoys being petted, is not too sure she likes being picked up and held, but loves to be a lap cat when it's her idea. She is a terrific combination of affection and independence. She also has a playful side, but Coffee is not going to be the sort to bother you all day long to play with her - give her a comfortable spot to chillax, and she will be just fine. She does well with other cats, or would also be happy as the only cat in the family. If you have a dog, we will be happy to dog-test her for you! She would be fine as an indoor-only or indoor/outdoor cat.
