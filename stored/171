Forget Me Not is currently assisting a semi-feral cat colony in crisis in Inchelium. These cats are too friendly to be "just" barn cats, and cannot be returned to their original site after neuter because there are dogs in the neighborhood that have decided the colony is their prey playground. As a result, we have taken in 39 cats and kittens from this colony, kittens ranging in age from 2 1/2 months to 6 months. All of them are seeking a safe place to call home; it can be indoor only, indoor-outdoor, or for some of them, outdoor only with appropriate food, water, shelter, and daily affection.

Kansas and her sister Vermont were born about 6/21/21.

Kansas is the sort of girl who says "STOP IT. I don't WANT to be loved. Petting... it... it feels so good... STOP IT. I don't WANT to like you!"

Vermont appears to be an existentialist, full of ennui, with a "FINE, if you MUST" attitude toward attention.

Both are handleable, and will most likely grow affectionate and playful after several months of consistency in their new homes. They would prefer someplace with a quiet, zen-like atmosphere, no dogs (other cats would be OK with them), and no loud or shrieky children. They would be perfect for someone who looks forward to long stretches of staring and slow-blinking to bond with their challenging cat.

The good news is, Forget Me Not is having a "Shy Cat Special" for the rest of 2021, so a shy cat or kitten has a $35 adoption fee, and you may add a second shy cat as a buddy at no additional cost!
