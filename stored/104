Baby is a lovely, gentle 12-year-old Lilac-point Siamese boy, who arrived at the shelter after his person died unexpectedly. He is understandably confused and depressed at losing his home, his Mom, and his dog friend. Relatives are able to bring the dog home, but allergies prevent Baby from joining a family member, so they have asked us to find him a new loving home where he can enjoy cuddles and sunspots for the rest of his days.

Baby is good with dogs. He has not lived with other cats, but doesn't seem to mind the cats he's met at the shelter. He's a sensitive soul and would love a calm, warm, quiet, loving lap to help him through his grief and find his joy again.
