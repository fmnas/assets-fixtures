Connecticut, born 10/1/19, arrived as part of a large feral colony on which we were doing Trap-Neuter-Return, and after meeting her, we felt she needed to be removed and rehomed as a pet. She just doesn't have the wild demeanor of a true feral adult, and seems to enjoy being held and petted; the more she is held and petted, the more friendly she gets. She will like a calm and relaxed home, with someone who has the patience to let her blossom at her own pace. She could be an indoor-only or indoor-outdoor cat.

She gets along fine with other cats, but we do NOT recommend dogs for Connecticut.

Sometimes in her photos she appears a bit fierce, but it is all bluster... she is really a sweetheart who just prefers to be left to her own devices, so she can cuddle with the other cats and eat kitty treats, rather than being photographed and moved to a better light location (ha).

You can see in her video, even though she flattens her ears she does allow us to pick her up. When she wants to be put back down, she is polite about it, and she doesn't run away. She enjoys being petted, and sometimes will just fall asleep during a relaxing session of pets.

The good news is, Forget Me Not is having a "Shy Cat Special" until further notice, so a shy cat or kitten has a $35 adoption fee, and if you like, you may add a second shy cat as a buddy at no additional cost!
